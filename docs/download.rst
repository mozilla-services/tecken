Basics
======

The Tecken webapp handles requests for symbols files. Tecken takes the request,
figures out which bucket the file is in, and returns a redirect to that bucket.
This allows us to use multiple buckets for symbols without requiring everyone
to maintain lists of buckets.

For example, at the time of this writing doing a ``GET`` for
:base_url:`/firefox.pdb/448794C699914DB8A8F9B9F88B98D7412/firefox.sym` will
return a ``302 Found`` redirect to
``https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/org.mozilla.crash-stats.symbols-public/v1/firefox.pdb/448794C699914DB8A8F9B9F88B98D7412/firefox.sym``.

Try Builds
==========

By default, when you request to download a symbol, Tecken will iterate through
a list of available S3 configurations.

To download symbols that might be part of a Try build you have to pass an
optional query string key ``try`` or you can prefix the URL with ``/try``.
For example:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ curl --user-agent "example/1.0" https://symbols.mozilla.org/tried.pdb/HEX/tried.sym?try
    ...302 Found...

    $ curl --user-agent "example/1.0" https://symbols.mozilla.org/try/tried.pdb/HEX/tried.sym
    ...302 Found...

If you specify that you're requesting a try build, Tecken will look at
all the S3 bucket locations as well as all the try locations in those
S3 buckets.

Symbols from Try builds is always tried last! So if there's a known symbol
called ``foo.pdb/HEX/foo.sym`` and someone triggers a Try build (which uploads
its symbols) with the exact same name (and build ID) and even if you use
``https://symbols.mozilla.org/foo.pdb/HEX/foo.sym?try`` the existing (non-Try
build) symbol will be matched first.


Downloading API
===============

.. http:head:: /<DEBUG_FILENAME>/<DEBUG_ID>/<SYMBOL_FILE>

   Determine whether the symbol file exists or not.

   :reqheader Debug: if ``true``, includes a ``Debug-Time`` header in the response.

      If ``Debug-Time`` is `0.0``: symbol file ends in an unsupported extension

   :reqheader User-Agent: please provide a unique user agent to make it easier for us
       to help you debug problems

   :query try: use ``try=1`` to download Try symbols

   :query _refresh: use ``_refresh=1`` to force Tecken to look for the symbol file
       in the AWS S3 buckets and update the cache

   :query code_id: the ``code_id`` from the module if any

   :query code_filename: the ``code_filename`` from the module if any

   :statuscode 200: symbol file exists
   :statuscode 404: symbol file does not exist
   :statuscode 500: sleep for a bit and retry; if retrying doesn't work, then please
       file a bug report
   :statuscode 503: sleep for a bit and retry

.. http:get:: /<DEBUG_FILENAME>/<DEBUG_ID>/<SYMBOL_FILE>

   Download a symbol file.

   :reqheader Debug: if ``true``, includes a ``Debug-Time`` header in the response.

      If ``Debug-Time`` is `0.0``: symbol file ends in an unsupported extension

   :reqheader User-Agent: please provide a unique user agent to make it easier for us
       to help you debug problems

   :query try: use ``try=1`` to download Try symbols

   :query _refresh: use ``_refresh=1`` to force Tecken to look for the symbol file
       in the AWS S3 buckets and update the cache

   :query code_id: the ``code_id`` from the module if any

   :query code_filename: the ``code_filename`` from the module if any

   :statuscode 302: symbol file was found and the final url was returned as a redirect
   :statuscode 400: requested symbol file has bad characters
   :statuscode 404: symbol file was not found
   :statuscode 429: sleep for a bit and retry
   :statuscode 500: sleep for a bit and retry; if retrying doesn't work, then please
       file a bug report
   :statuscode 503: sleep for a bit and retry

.. http:head:: /try/<DEBUG_FILENAME>/<DEBUG_ID>/<SYMBOL_FILE>

   Same as ``HEAD /<DEBUG_FILENAME>/<DEBUG_ID>/<SYMBOL_FILE>``, but for try symbols.

.. http:get:: /try/<DEBUG_FILENAME>/<DEBUG_ID>/<SYMBOL_FILE>

   Same as ``GET /<DEBUG_FILENAME>/<DEBUG_ID>/<SYMBOL_FILE>``, but for try symbols.
