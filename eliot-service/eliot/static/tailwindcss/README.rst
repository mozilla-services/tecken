This is tailwindcss version 2.2.16 downloaded from
`<https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-tailwind-via-cdn>`_.

.. Note:: 2021-10-06

   We don't build tailwindcss because we only use it on one static page. If at
   some point we switch the rest of Tecken to use tailwindcss, then we should
   build it so we can take advantage of features and components and such.
